# I Like Logic

## My solve:
So basically we have a .sal file, which need to be to analysed by logic 2.
For analysing it , we use Async serial analyser.
Then we infer to the terminal. The terminal had a junk of waste text, in the middle was the flag.

*Flag:* FCSC{b4dce4eaddf8c14e60aab1412b0b465344e64b12a4f10d6d0e95c89ba5c52d9925}
