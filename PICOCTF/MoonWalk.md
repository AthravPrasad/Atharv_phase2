# MoonWalk
Decode this message from the moon.

## My Solve:
Firstly i tried a lot of audio stuff like morse code and other tools.
These efforts proved ineffective and I switched to the hint provided that how messages would be sent from the moon to earth.
The answer was SSTV, I used an online sstv translator and got the audio file translated, got an image and extracted the flag.

*Flag:* picoCTF{beep_boop_im_in_space}

## Notes:
None.
